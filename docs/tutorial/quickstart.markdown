   - Fully spectral using Fourier, Chebyshev, Worland and Associated Legendre basis
   - Multiple geometries: spherical shell, full sphere, cylinder, plane layer, cartesian box
   - Sparse formulation of the linear operators
   - High-level Python interface for the linear operators
   - Nonlinear simulations
   - Linear stability calculations using PETSc/SLEPc
   - 1D, 2D and 2.5D parallelisation

## Quick Start

0. Upload your SSH key to your github profile
1. Clone repository
   ```bash
   git clone -b main git@github.com:QuICC/QuICC.git
   ```

2. Create build directory
   ```bash
   mkdir </path/to/Builds>
   cd </path/to/Builds>
   ```
3. Configure build with CMake specifying the model(s) to build
   ```bash
   cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DQUICC_MODEL=<GreatSimulation1>\;<GreatSimulation2>
   ```
   The physical model descriptions are stored in separate git repositories. A list of existing models is obtained [here](https://github.com/QuICC?q=Model-+in%3Aname&type=&language=). All official model repositories follow the naming "Model-<GreatSimulation>".

   The registered models are cloned into Models/.

   Custom models can be added into Models/.

4. Compile the model executables
   ```bash
   make && make install
   ```
5. Create configuration XML
   ```bash
   </path/to/Builds>/bin/<GreatSimulation>Config
   mv parameters_GEOMETRY.cfg parameters.cfg
   edit parameters.cfg
   ```
6. Create initial state
   ```bash
   </path/to/Builds>/bin/<GreatSimulation>State
   mv state0000.hdf5 state_initial.hdf5
   ```
7. Run simulation
   ```bash
   </path/to/Builds>/bin/<GreatSimulation>Model
   ```
8. Create physical space data for visualization
   ```bash
   ln -s state0042.hdf5 state4Visu.hdf5
   </path/to/Builds>/bin/<GreatSimulation>Visu
   ```
9. visualize *visState0000.hdf5*

## Benchmarks

A set of benchmarks is provided in the [Benchmarks](https://github.com/QuICC/Benchmarks) repository.


## Tests

Tests are provided for some of the components.
First, one need to enable the compilation, for instance
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DQUICC_TESTSUITE_<component>=ON
```
then, after compiling, one can run all the available tests

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```
or a specific test
```bash
ctest -R <only-this-test> --output-on-failure
```

## Code completion in Vim

Copy or link the compilation database "compilation_commands.json" into the root of QuICC in order to use [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe)

The database can be generated in a build directory using Clang++ as compiler with
#$> cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 .

## Custom models
The default repository and branch can be changed, for instance
```bash
cmake .. -DQUICC_MODEL=<myModel> -DQUICC_MODEL_GIT_REPO_BASE=<myRepo> -DQUICC_MODEL_GIT_BRANCH=<myBranch>
```
Remember that the repository full name should be in the form `<myRepo><myModel>`!

Additionally, they can be specified on a per model basis, for instance
```bash
cmake .. -DQUICC_MODEL=<myModel1>\;<myModel2> -DQUICC_MODEL_GIT_BRANCH_<myModel1>=<myBranch>
```

## Platform specific builds
To check the options selected, use the verbose mode:
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> --log-level=VERBOSE
```

For instructions about known clusters refer to `README_clusters.md`.


### General optimization
It is always better to compile for the target architecture (this is not necessary on Piz-Daint as CC will do it for you)
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native"
```
and to enable vectorized code generation in the `Eigen` library
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DQUICC_EIGEN_ENABLE_VECTORIZATION=ON
```

## Forcing specific libraries

### Boost
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DBOOST_ROOT=</path/to/boost>
```

### Python
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DPython_ROOT_DIR=</path/to/python>
```

## Known issues

### MKL
MKL has a FFTW interface that, if loaded in front, can create issues by intercepting calls for FFTW. This is not a problem in itself except that MKL does not provide all the plans that are used in QuICC.
One could still use MKL for the BLAS back-end and ensure that the FFTW shared object is loaded first as follows:
```bash
LD_PRELOAD=</path/to/FFTW>/libfftw3.so <executable>
```


## Debugging

### gdb hook
By setting the enviroment variable `QUICC_GDB_HOOK` to a non-negative integer value, that process will print its PID and wait
```bash
QUICC_GDB_HOOK=0 mpirun -n 4 <executable>
```
## Profiling

Enabled by selecting the desired back-end and granularity level, for instance
```bash
cmake </path/to/QuICC> -DQUICC_PROFILE_BACKEND=native -DQUICC_PROFILE_LEVEL=0
```
### barrier
By setting the enviroment variable `QUICC_PROFILE_MPI_BARRIER` to either `after` and/or `before` a mpi barrier will be set before and/or after each region

# Use docker image

In order to simplify setting up a local version of QuICC, a docker image with required dependencies installed is provided. The latest image can be found on docker hub at [quicc/buildbase](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/quicc/buildbase/general). The setup described below will mount the `</path/to/QuICC_mnt>` directory into the container. Everything that needs to remain even after stopping the docker container should be stored in this directory. For example, source and build directory should be created in `</path/to/QuICC_mnt>`. In the commands below, `</path/to/QuICC_mnt>` needs to be replaced with an actual path.

## Linux and MacOS

### Setup docker

The following steps should produce a working environment:
 1. Install docker:
    - *Linux:* Follow instructions for your distribution.
    - *MacOS:* Install docker desktop from [Install on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
 2. Add your SSH keys to the SSH agent if not already present, i.e. for each key you need, run:
    ```bash
    ssh-add </path/to/SSH_KEY>
    ```
 3. Start docker
 4. Open Terminal:
    - Pull docker image from hub
     ```bash
     docker pull quicc/buildbase:latest
     ```
    - Create directory where sources and builds will be kept. This directory is persistent and will be mounted into the container.
    ```bash
    mkdir </path/to/QuICC_mnt>
    ```
    - Clone QuICC repository into `<path/to/QuICC_mnt>`, for example to clone the `main` branch:
    ```bash
    git clone -b main git@github.com:QuICC/QuICC </path/to/QuICC_mnt>/QuICC
    ```
    
### Run docker image in Linux

The directory `</path/to/QuICC_mnt>` will be mounted into the container under `/QuICC`. The content of this directory is persistent and will not disappear when the container is deleted.
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
-v </path/to/QuICC_mnt>:/QuICC \
--mount type=bind,src="$SSH_AUTH_SOCK",target=/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock \
-e SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
quicc/buildbase:latest
```

If everything worked, you should now be inside the container. Create a build directory in `/QuICC` and proceed as usual to configure, build and run QuICC.
    
### Run docker image in MacOS

The directory `</path/to/QuICC_mnt>` will be mounted into the container under `/QuICC`. The content of this directory is persistent and will not disappear when the container is deleted.
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
-v </path/to/QuICC_mnt>:/QuICC \
--mount type=bind,src="/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock",target=/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock \
-e SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock" \
quicc/buildbase:latest
```

If everything worked, you should now be inside the container. Create a build directory in `/QuICC` and proceed as usual to configure, build and run QuICC.

# Linear stability calculations

QuICC provides a set of Python scripts to do linear stability calculations. The tools require PETSc and SLEPc, as well as their Python bindings petsc4py and slepc4py. As those library are quite complex and provide a lot of different options during installation, obtaining the right setup can be challenging. In order to simplify the setup, a docker image which contains all dependencies is provided. The image is available on the docker hub as "quicc/stability". In order to use it, follow the instructions above to setup docker but use "quicc/stability" in place of "quicc/buildbase".

## Run the marginal curve tracing tool

Let's assume the configured build directory is called `build_dir` and the model used is `BoussinesqSphereRTC`. To trace a marginal curve do the following:
 1. Change to build directory
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/build_dir
    ```
 2. Copy linear stability files to build directory
    ```bash
    make quicc_pyquicc quicc_boussinesqspherertc_updatepy
    ```
 3. The scripts are installed under `lib64/python/linear_stability`
    ```bash
    cd lib64/python/linear_stability/boussinesq/sphere/rtc/
    ```
 4. Define the parameters and options in `trace_marginal.py`. The script contains a few examples for different parameters, resolutions, etc. At the bottom of the file are the main options for the tracing tool. The options are described in `lib64/python/quicc/linear_stability/marginal_curve.py` in `default_options` line 597. The main options are
    - `marginal_options['curve']`: True/False trace marginal curve
    - `marginal_options['minimum']`: True/False compute minimum
    - `marginal_options['solve']`: True/False compute single point
    - `marginal_options['solve_nev']`: Number of eigenvalues to compute
    - `marginal_options['curve_points']`: list of modes where to compute the marginal curve
 5. Tell Python where to find the modules
    ```bash
    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/build_dir/lib64/python
    ```
 6. Run the marginal curve tracing script:
    ```bash
    python trace_marginal.py -st_type sinvert -eps_target 0 -eps_target_real
    ```
