Spectral index ordering: \f$C_1 C_2 C_3 \rightarrow I_{1D} I_{3D} I_{2D}\f$

Physical index ordering: \f$C_1 C_2 C_3 \rightarrow I_{3D} I_{2D} I_{1D}\f$

Derivatives for gradients are computed in spectral order: \f$C_1 C_2 C_3\f$ 

leads to:
   - ONE: \f$\partial_{C_1}\f$
   - TWO: \f$\partial_{C_2}\f$
   - THREE: \f$\partial_{C_3}\f$
