# \<file\> tag

This part of the file is used by the XML reader to check the right type of file is used. It should not be modified.

# \<framework\> tag

The framework part of the contains simulation independent parameters. Except for the truncation part, everything is also independent of the geometry of the problem.

   - \<truncation\> tag:

      + Resolution of the simulation: \<dim1D\>, \<dim2D\>, \<dim3D\>. The value given is the highest index in the expansion and the first index is 0. For example 19 will compute the simulation with 20 modes.

      + For periodic directions, the box size in units of \f$k_c\f$ is set by \<box2D\>, \<box3D\>

      + For periodic directions, the unit length of the box is set by \<kc2D\>, \<kc3D\>

   - \<parallel\> tag:

      Set the number of processor to be used. If a serial code has been compiled, \<cpus\> has to be 1. If a MPI code has been compiled \<cpus\> has to be at least 2. While there is no formal constain on the number of CPUs, best performance is usually achieved with a even number of CPUs. Furthermore, for a "Tubular" parallelisation the best performance is achieved with a number of CPUs that can be factorized into smaller factors.

   - \<timestepping\> tag:

      - \<time\> tag:
         
         This tags sets the initial time of the simulations. A value of zero or larger will set the initial time to the given value. A value of -1 will use the time provided in the initial state file. IMPORTANT NOTE: When converting state files to visualization files this should be set to -1, otherwise the time information in the visualization file will be wrong.

      - \<timestep\> tag:

         This tag sets the timestep to used if it is positive. A negative value will use an adaptive timestep scheme but it is not yet working properly.


   - \<run\> tag:

      - \<sim\> tag:

         This tag sets the simulation time constain. Set to 0, no simulation time constrain is imposed. A positive value will stop the simulation if the given simulation time is reached. This is NOT the wall time, it is based on the actual integration time. A negative value sets a limit on the number of timesteps.

      - \<wall\> tag:

         This tag sets the wall time of the simulation. Set to 0, there is not wall time. A positive decimal value, is the wall time in hours.

   - \<io\> tag:

      - \<ascii\> tag:

         Controls the frequency of the ASCII file output. The value should be a positive integer representing the frequency in timesteps at which the ASCII files should be written.

      - \<hdf5\> tag:

         Controls the frequency of the HDF5 file output. The value should be a positive integer representing the frequency in timesteps at which the HDF5 files should be written.

# \<simulation\> tag

The simulation part depends on the simulation that is being used.

   - \<physical\> tag:
      
      This part contains the nondimensional parameters of the simulation. Meaning of the parameters should be checked in the Python model file.

   - \<boundary\> tag:
      
      This part contains the boundary condition flags of the simulation. Meaning of the values should be checked in the Python model file.
